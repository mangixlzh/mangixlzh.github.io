Fresh, cool ale here!

Is trouble brewing?

Name your posion!

You seem a little parched.

Another round?

Oh! Gladly!

I'll give it a shot.

Have one on the house.

I'll put it on your tab.

For Pandaria!

This will be grisly/grizzly!

Now you're endangered!

I bring Panda-monium!

Prepare to get trashed!

Ale is my bear necessity.

Last Call before closing.

Come drown your sorrows.

This'll put hair all over you.

I'd kiss you, but I've got puke breath.

My dad... he was bipolar.

I can't breed in captivity.

*burp* Sorry.
