I have asked DeepSeek how to happy hacking and this is what it tells me.

Everything starts with : What If? More than using the tools, one should try to break and modify them.

Just like reading stories, you should start to read the original code, then a brand new world is open for you.

Like everything else, trust the process! Enjoy every small problems you have been tackling and the joy of bringing order to chaos. Bro, I would say this is very much like Physics, or other things I like.

Every bug is a hint and the whole process is like playing as a detective.

Make yourself a sandbox. Play in the sandbox, there is no such thing as mistakes, only discoveries!

Put what you have done in a blog, social media or even Github! Yes, get enrolled in an Open-source Project!

Use Emacs and make your shell work for you!

Remeber, automize everything!

More specificaly， start with small projects!

Websites like [Hack The Box](https://www.hackthebox.com/) and [OverTheWire](https://overthewire.org/wargames/) will help.

Rewrite an old code of yours!

Learn a new language!

Try to learn from other hackers!

You could hack from GitHub, tags with "good first issue"!

Build your personal website.

Play with API.

Play with Hardware.

And the most important thing: Be happy, Be curious!
