## Reading

I have a particular love for short stories.(In other words, I have no patience for "Tome".`:)`)

Mind Snacks:

**Italo Calvino**: *Our Ancestors Trilogy* (*The Cloven Viscount*, *The Baron in the Trees*, *The Nonexistent Knight*)
**Jorge Luis Borges**: *The Aleph*, *The Man on the Corner of the Rose Street*
**Juan Rulfo**: *Pedro PÃ¡ramo*



## Board Games

I prefer Euro-style board games over American-style ones.

- Forest Shuffle
- Wingspan
- Agricola
- The Gaia Project
  
## Video Games

Like my taste of books, I prefer video games that are short to play while highly replayable.

Moments of Escape:

- Faster than Light
- Into the Breach
- Slay the Spire

Exception : Journeys of Immersion

- Divinity: Original Sin 2
