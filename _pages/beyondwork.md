## Reading

I have a particular love for short stories.(In other words, I have no patience for "Tome".`:)`)

### Mind Snacks:

**Italo Calvino**: *Our Ancestors Trilogy* (*The Cloven Viscount*, *The Baron in the Trees*, *The Nonexistent Knight*)

**Jorge Luis Borges**: *The Aleph*, *Man on Pink Corner*

**Juan Rulfo**: *Pedro PÃ¡ramo*



## Board Games

I prefer Euro-style board games over American-style ones.

- Forest Shuffle
- Wingspan
- Agricola
- The Gaia Project
  
## Video Games

Like my taste of books, I prefer video games that are short to play while highly replayable.

Moments of Escape:

- FTL:Faster Than Light
![FTL]({{ "/assets/images/ftl.webp" | relative_url }})
- Into the Breach
- Slay the Spire
- Dota 2(Mangix is my favorite)
    - A slam of Mangix' mighty keg starts the festivities.
    - The Order of the Oyo's solution to all problems - another round!
    - When Mangix won his title as the Brewmaster of the Order of Oyo, he also claimed his place in the mastery of inebriation.
    - Mangix doesn't hold to it by rule, but he vaguely recalls an old master musing that, if one could manage, scaring up a companion was always preferable to drinking alone.
    - It isn't clear whether Mangix is consciously aware of his potent bond with nature, as it often occurs in the midst of a drunken stupor.

Exception : Journeys of Immersion

- Divinity: Original Sin 2
