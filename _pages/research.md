## Quasi-normal Mode and Gravitational Lensing

Working with Yin Chengjiang and He Jianhua.

I am simulating a plane wave passing through a black hole and analyze the signal after the interaction.

In view of black hole, this could be explained with black hole pertubation theory, nor more exactly: quasi-normal modes(QNMs).

In view of the gravitational wave, this could be viewed as gravitational lensing.

Our work shows that the gravitational lensing and black hole pertubation is actually two sides of the same coin.

## Normalizing Flow in search of Lensed Signal

Working with Jef Heynen, Mick Wright and Justin Janquart.

With the help of the best collabarators, I tried to implement a lensed waveform in the open-source gravitational wave parameter estimation pipeline:jimgw.
  
## Galactic Chemical Evolution Model

Working with Eda Gjergo

With the help of Eda, I am trying to extend a one-zone model into a multi-zone one. I further compared the data of SDSS-APOGEE.

## About Gaia DR3 

Working with Li Jiadong

This is an ongoing project and I am really happy to be able to work with Jiadong.
